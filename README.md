# Shopping List

Shopping List is a Python terminal app that lets user make a list of what to buy, or pretty much everything needing items, quantity and measurements, such as the ingridients of a recipe. It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

It's a simple app where users can create and name as many lists as they need to. They are also able to view existing lists and add items to the list or delete items. And if users don't need the list anymore, they can also delete the list.

## User Stories

In order not to forget something, this project was inspired by the users constant need to make a list when grocery shopping.

## Features

### Existing Features
The users are welcomed at the start of the app and will be shown existing lists if there is any. The users are also asked what they would like to do:
 * Exit main menu - to exit the app
 * Add new list - to create and name a new list, then users will also be given the options to:
      - Exit new list menu - to go back to the main menu, or
      - Add items - to add new items to the list, where the users will enter item, quantity and unit of measurement.
 * View lists - to view the shopping list and the items in it. A numbered list of the shopping lists will be shown to the users where they can select the number of the list they want to view the items. The users are shown a tabulated display of the items in the list. In this option the users will also be given the options to:
      - Exit list menu - to go back to the main menu, or
      - Add new item - to add items to the list, or
      - Delete an item - to delete an item from the list. The items will be shown again for users to select which item to delete. The Users will be asked to enter the item they want to delete and will also be asked to confirm deletion of the item before proceeding to execute the deletion.
 * Delete list - to delete a list. The numbered list of shopping lists wil be shown again for users to select which list to delete. After entering which list, the users will also be asked to confirm deletion before proceeding to delete the list.

### Future Features
* Allow users to quit anytime in the process.
* Allow users to edit items.

## Testing

Testing was carried out throughout the build of the project by utilising print statements to ensure the project was running as envisioned.

Tested in my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal giving invalid inputs to check for the functionality of the validation codes. 

The code was also run through a [PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and confirmed there are no errors.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

1. The app still continues to ask user to enter item name when 2 is entered  where there are only 0 and 1 options provided in the new list menu.
     Solution: Added an if clause for when 1 is entered, else other than 0 and 1 is invalid.
2. The app creates a list with the same name.
     Solution: Added a validation code to check if the entered list name is already exists.
3. Errors were raised for a variable not defined.
     Solution: While modifying some functions some variables were renamed while some were not unnoticed. These variables were renamed and others which are typo were also corrected.

### Remaining Bugs

1. Arrow keys, page up and page down are accepted when entering a list name or an item. And while the special characters (ex. ^[[D) appear on the spreadsheet, it does not show on the terminal.
